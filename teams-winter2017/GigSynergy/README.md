In this project we are trying to design and develop a web service prototype which can locate nearest Urgent Care facilities and provide a patient with waiting time. The patient can then select the Urgent Care facility and can check in online. We will design user interfaces for both patient and Urgent Care sides. In addition, we will design required RDB with MySQL in such a way that data can be retrieved fast. We will use Java for back-end; we recruit JavaScript and AngularJS for front-end programming though. In order to develop a streamlined communication between the server and browser, we will use JSON.
